# Contributing to Website Verticalizer

Thank you for your interest in contributing!
We welcome bug reports, fixes, features, documentation, and tests.

To avoid duplication, the authoritative user/ops documentation (architecture, environment, CLI usage) lives in README.md, and the full scope/requirements live in spec.md. This guide focuses on contributor workflow and quality gates.

- Project overview, architecture, environment, commands: see README.md
- Full project requirements and acceptance criteria: see spec.md

## Makefile Tasks

Common tasks (executed via Poetry):

- make install ‚Äî install dependencies
- make fmt ‚Äî format code (ruff format)
- make lint ‚Äî lint code (ruff check)
- make test ‚Äî run tests (pytest)
- make cov ‚Äî coverage
- make clean ‚Äî remove caches and build artifacts
- make qa ‚Äî fmt + lint + test

---

## Workflow

1) Create an issue (bug/feature) or pick one from the tracker.  
2) Branch:
   - feature/
   - fix/
   - docs/
3) Implement your change; keep PRs small and focused.  
4) Run the quality gate locally:
```
make qa
```
5) Open a PR (describe changes, link issues, attach logs/screenshots if CLI UX changed).  
6) Address review feedback until approval and merge.

---

## Style & Testing

- Formatter: Ruff (ruff format)
- Linter: Ruff (ruff check)
- Tests: pytest under ./tests (or adjust Makefile)

Commands
```
make fmt
make lint
make test
make cov
```

Keep PRs lint-clean. If adding new rules, update pyproject.toml.

## Environment & Secrets

- See README.md ‚Üí Installation for environment variables.
- Never commit secrets. `.env` is gitignored.

---

## Backwards Compatibility

- If you change CLI flags or I/O formats, update:
  - README.md
  - Module-level READMEs under src/verticalizer/apps/*/
- Document any breaking changes clearly in the PR and changelog.
